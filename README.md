# Card-game-War
A C# version of card game War. in which both players receive half of a deck of 52 shuffled cards. At the start of the game a trump suite gets selected randomly. On each turn, both players reveal the top card of their deck. Cards are compared by their rank with trump cards being higher than non-trump cards. Player with a higher ranking card gets both cards and sets them to a separate pile (score pile). If the cards are of equal value, each player gets his own card back to the score pile. The game is played until both players have no cards and in the end the player with more cards in their score pile wins the game.
